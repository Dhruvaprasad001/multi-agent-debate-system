## Agent Design Decisions

- **Research**: Neutral fact gathering using web tools; feeds shared state.
- **Optimist**: Pro-position advocacy grounded in research facts.
- **Critic**: Risk-aware analysis and counterpoints, also grounded in facts.
- **Mediator**: Objective synthesis and loop control (continue vs end).
